Proposal: Face Recognition Integration for Client Filtering 

Group: Chen, Parker and Zhang, Jerry

Overview: Extend the "UserSimpleSelfieRegister" project by adding face recognition to enhance client verification and filtering.

Objectives:

Integrate Face Recognition: Use libraries like face_recognition or OpenCV to identify and match client selfies against stored data.
Streamline Verification: Automate client filtering based on real-time recognition, reducing manual checks.
Enhance User Experience: Provide secure and efficient client management.
Approach:

Encode Client Images: Pre-process and encode stored images for efficient matching.
Develop Recognition Pipeline: Implement a system to capture, encode, and match input selfies.
UI Enhancements: Display recognition results in the app interface.
Outcomes: Improved accuracy, automated verification, and better security. Privacy measures will be in place to protect client data.

Conclusion: This addition will automate and improve client filtering, boosting both efficiency and reliability.
